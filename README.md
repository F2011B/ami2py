Python Package for reading and writing from and to an amibroker database.<br/>
This package is using construct for defining the binary structures used to access the amibroker database, 
see [Construct documentation](https://construct.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). <br/>
The specification of the binary structure was taken from the official amibroker C++ sdk api documentation.

However, this is not an official amibroker database api. <br/> 
Therefore, no warranty is given and handle with care. <br/>
Improvement requests are always welcome.<br/>
